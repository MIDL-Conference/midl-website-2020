# Author instructions

Conference submissions follow two tracks: *full conference papers* and *extended abstracts*.
All accepted full papers will be published as a volume in the [Proceedings of Machine Learning Research](http://proceedings.mlr.press/).

## Extended abstracts

Extended abstracts are up to 3 pages (excluding references and acknowledgements) and can, for example, focus on preliminary novel methodological ideas without extensive validation. We also specifically accept extended abstracts of recently published or submitted journal contributions to give authors the opportunity to present their work and obtain feedback from the community. Selection of abstracts is performed via a lightweight double-blind review process via OpenReview. All accepted abstracts will be presented as posters at the conference.

**Submission deadline:** 30 January 2020, 23:59 UTC-12

## Full papers

Full papers contain well-validated applications or methodological contributions of deep learning algorithms in medical imaging. There is no strict limit on paper length. However, we strongly recommend keeping full papers at 8 pages (excluding references and acknowledgements). An appendix section can be added if needed with additional details but must be compiled into a single PDF. The appropriateness of using pages over the recommended page length will be judged by reviewers. Full papers will go through a double-blind peer-reviewing process via OpenReview, including a two weeks discussion period. All accepted papers will be presented as posters with a selection of these papers will also be invited for oral presentation.

**Submission deadline:** 30 January 2020, 23:59 UTC-12

## Latex template

To prepare your submission to MIDL 2020 either as a full paper or an extended abstract, please use the LaTeX style files provided at:
[https://github.com/MIDL-Conference/MIDLLatexTemplate](https://github.com/MIDL-Conference/MIDLLatexTemplate)

## Dual submission policy

### Full papers

Submissions that are substantially similar or identical to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences with proceedings or journals, are not allowed.

### Extended abstracts

In addition to original work, authors can choose to submit a shortened version of a recently (within the year 2018 or 2019) published, or submitted, journal publication to foster dissemination of high-quality work. Submissions that are substantially similar or identical to versions that have been accepted or submitted in parallel to other conferences with proceedings are not allowed.

In both cases, dual submission of your paper to a non-peer reviewed website like arXiv is allowed. Similarly, submissions that have been presented at non-archival workshops (i.e., venues that do not have publication proceedings or publish only a very short abstract) do not violate the policy.

The policy is enforced during the whole reviewing process period.

## Withdrawing policy and rejected papers

Authors have the right to withdraw papers from consideration at any time until the paper submission deadline. After the submission deadline and during the paper review process, it will not be possible to withdraw a paper. After the decisions are announced, it will be possible for authors to withdraw a rejected paper. At any stage, if an author withdraws the paper, it will be deleted from the OpenReview hosting site.

## Reviewing process

1. Submissions to MIDL can be made either as a full paper or as an extended abstract.
2. Submissions to MIDL are uploaded on OpenReview, which enables public discussion. Official reviews are anonymous and publicly visible. However, reviews from the Public (=anybody who is logged in can post comments) will only be released after the decisions are announced. The author of a comment can decide to post anonymously or not. Login is required before posting any comment.
3. Extended abstract submissions will undergo a lighter review.
4. By January 28, 2019, reviewers need to post their full review. Official reviews are anonymous by default and publicly visible in Open Review
5. The rebuttal and discussion period will be from January 28, 2019 until February 10, 2019, where authors can address reviewer comments.
6. On February 20, 2019, authors will be notified about the acceptance or rejection of their paper.
7. Papers that are not accepted will be considered non-archival, and may be submitted elsewhere at the discretion of the authors. We strongly encourage taking into account the reviewers comments before resubmitting. During submission, the authors will have the option to indicate whether to have their submissions, the reviews, and the comments to be deleted from the OpenReview site, in case their submission is rejected.

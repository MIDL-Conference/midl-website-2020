# Author instructions

MIDL 2020 submissions follow two tracks: *full* and *short* papers. All accepted full papers will be published as a volume in the [Proceedings of Machine Learning Research](http://proceedings.mlr.press/). We will be using [openreview.net](https://openreview.net) as a submission and reviewing platform, with a two-week period for author rebuttal and discussion for full-paper submissions. To submit a paper, authors need to have an updated OpenReview account. Visit [http://openreview.net/profile](http://openreview.net/profile) after logging in.

{{ button("Register a short or full paper", "https://openreview.net/group?id=MIDL.io/2020/Conference") }}

After the registration period is over the Submission button will be inactive. To upload your pdf, select your paper and press “Revision”.

**Inquiries to the program chairs can be addressed directly to [pcs@2020.midl.io](mailto:pcs@2020.midl.io).**

## Full papers

Full papers contain well-validated applications or methodological contributions of deep learning algorithms in medical imaging. There is no strict limit on paper length. However, we strongly recommend keeping full papers at 8 pages (excluding references and acknowledgements). An appendix section can be added if needed with additional details but must be compiled into a single PDF. The appropriateness of using pages over the recommended page length will be judged by reviewers. Full papers will go through a **double-blind** peer-reviewing process via OpenReview, with a two-week period for author rebuttal and discussion. All accepted papers will be presented as posters with a selection of these papers will also be invited for oral presentation.

## Short papers

Short papers are up to 3 pages (excluding references and acknowledgements) and can, for example, focus on preliminary novel methodological ideas without extensive validation. We also specifically accept short papers of recently published or submitted journal contributions to give authors the opportunity to present their work and obtain feedback from the community. Selection of short papers is based on a light **double-blind** review process via OpenReview, without a discussion period. All accepted abstracts will be presented as posters at the conference.

## Paper registration step (important)

To be able to upload the PDF of a paper (full and short) before January 30th, authors have to create a submission on openreview with title, abstract and author information by January 24th (paper registration deadline).


## Latex template

To prepare your submission to MIDL 2020 either as a full or short paper, please use the LaTeX style files provided at:
[https://github.com/MIDL-Conference/MIDLLatexTemplate](https://github.com/MIDL-Conference/MIDLLatexTemplate).

**Make sure that the submitted PDF is anonymous**. Only the final, accepted version should have author names.


## Dual submission policy
### Full papers

Submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that are submitted in parallel to other conferences with proceedings or journals, are not allowed.

### Short papers

In addition to original work, authors can choose to submit a shortened version of a recently (within the year 2019 or 2020) published, or submitted, journal publication to foster dissemination of high-quality work. Submissions that are substantially similar to versions that have been accepted or submitted in parallel to other conferences with proceedings are not allowed.

In both cases, dual submission of your paper to a non-peer reviewed website like arXiv is allowed. Similarly, submissions that have been presented at non-archival workshops (i.e., venues that do not have publication proceedings or publish only a very short abstract) do not violate the policy.

The policy is enforced during the whole reviewing process period.


## Withdrawing policy and rejected papers
Authors have the right to withdraw papers from consideration at any time until the paper submission deadline. After the submission deadline and during the paper review process, it will not be possible to withdraw a paper. After the decisions are announced, it will be possible for authors to withdraw a rejected paper. At any stage, if an author withdraws the paper, it will be deleted from the OpenReview hosting site.

## Reviewing process
1. Submissions can be made either as a full or short paper.
1. Submissions are uploaded on OpenReview, which enables public discussion. However, the official reviews will be private during the review period, and will become publicly visible only after the reviews become available to authors. Comments that are posted by reviewers will remain anonymous.
1. Authors can choose to delete their rejected submissions from the OpenReview hosting site.
1. Reviews from the Public (=anybody who is logged in can post comments) will be released only after the reviews are made available to authors. The author of a comment can decide to post anonymously or not. Login is required before posting any comment.
1. Submissions to MIDL will be **double-blind** (Reviewers cannot see author names when conducting reviews, and authors cannot see reviewer names).
1. Short-paper submissions will undergo a lighter review, and do not have a period for rebuttal and author discussion.
1. Reviews of full papers will be made available to authors on March 20th, and the authors have until March 27th to submit a rebuttal and update their papers on OpenReview.
1. The period from March 27th  to April 3rd will be for open discussion between the authors and reviewers (full paper only), with the Area Chair guiding the discussion towards essential points.
1. On April 10th, authors will be notified about the acceptance or rejection of their paper (both full and short papers).
1. Papers that are not accepted will be considered non-archival, and may be submitted elsewhere at the discretion of the authors. We strongly encourage taking into account the reviewers comments before resubmitting. During submission, the authors will have the option to indicate whether to have their submissions, the reviews, and the comments to be deleted from the OpenReview site, in case their submission is rejected.

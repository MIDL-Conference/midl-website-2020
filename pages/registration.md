## Invitation letters

Invitation letters will be made available for participants upon registration to the conference.

<!-- For authors of extended abstracts planning to register conditionally upon acceptance of their extended abstract submission, to help with visa processing times, an invitation letter can be made available in advance through an early submission of a valid extended abstract. Validity of the submission will be judged by the conference organisers. Early extended abstract submissions may be updated until the standard submission deadline and will follow the same review / decision process and timeline as any other extended abstract. Early submissions must be performed through the normal abstract submission procedure using OpenReview, additionally, an email linking to the submission and asking for an invitation letter should be made to [visa@2020.midl.io](mailto:visa@2020.midl.io). -->

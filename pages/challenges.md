# Official MIDL 2020 challenges

For the first time, MIDL invites the community to propose challenges involving **both medical imaging and machine learning** topics.

## object-CXR
#### Automatic detection of foreign objects on chest X-rays

We provide a large dataset of chest X-rays with strong annotations of foreign objects, and the competition for automatic detection of foreign objects. Specifically, 5000 frontal chest X-ray images with foreign objects (all manually annotated) as well as 5000 frontal chest X-ray images without foreign objects are provided.

## MC-MRRec
#### Multi-channel MR Image Reconstruction Challenge

The challenge has two separate tracks, and teams are free to decide whether to submit to just one track or both; we encourage teams to submit to both tracks. Each track will have a separate ranking.

In these two tracks, we will assess MR reconstruction quality and noticeable loss of high resolution detail, especially at the higher acceleration rates. By having two separate tracks, we hope to determine whether a generic reconstruction model applicable to various multi-channel coils will have a decreased performance (if any) compared to more coil-specific reconstruction models.

# Call for challenges

For the first time, MIDL invites the community to propose challenges involving **both medical imaging and machine learning** topics.  Challenges oriented towards segmentation, classification, registration, diagnostics, localization, tractography, signal restoration, image reconstruction, privacy protection, adversarial attacks on medical data, to name a few, are welcome.

## Submission details

According to a recent study on common practice in biomedical image analysis ([Maier-Hein et al., 2018](https://sable.madmimi.com/c/94381?id=1104445.3183.1.26ef38fc01ee08daf7b0415f0376c41d)), reproduction and adequate interpretation of challenge results are often not possible, because only a fraction of relevant information is typically reported. To address this issue, like MICCAI 2020, we use an online platform for challenge proposal submissions with structured descriptions of challenge protocols.  This platform will ensure the completeness of the information for a high-quality challenge review as well as structured access to the challenge information in the future. Additionally, It may help organizers improve the design of their challenge.

The challenge submission site will start accepting submissions on **December 1st, 2019**. Proposal submissions are due on **January 15 2020**.

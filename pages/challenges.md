### Automatic detection of foreign objects on chest X-rays

We provide a large dataset of chest X-rays with strong annotations of foreign objects, and the competition for automatic detection of foreign objects. Specifically, 5000 frontal chest X-ray images with foreign objects (all manually annotated) as well as 5000 frontal chest X-ray images without foreign objects are provided.

        'We work on the breast imaging malignancy segmentation task while focusing on the train- ing process instead of network complexity. We designed a training process based on a modified U-Net, increasing the overall segmentation performances by using both, benign and malignant data for training. Our approach makes use of only a small amount of anno- tated data and relies on transfer learning from a self-supervised reconstruction task, and favors explainability.'

#### Brain Imaging: Past, Present and Future

**Biography:** Alan Evans is James McGill Professor of Neurology and Psychiatry at McGill. Trained in physics and protein crystallography, his current research covers [multi-modal brain imaging and structural network modeling](https://mcin.ca/). He is Scientific Director of both McGill’s $84M CFREF project [Healthy Brains for Healthy Lives](https://www.mcgill.ca/hbhl) and the [Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform](https://conp.ca/). He is also co-Director of the Ludmer Centre for Neuroinformatics and Mental Health, using high-performance computing to integrate imaging, behavior, genetics data in research into neurodegeneration and neurodevelopment. He has 653 peer-reviewed papers (ISI h-index=130 ; Google Scholar h-index=192). In 2014, he received the Vezina Prize for QuébecNeuroradiology, the national Margolese Human Brain Disorders Prize and was a Highly Cited Scientist (149,596 citations ; top 1%) for Neuroscience and Behavior. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and 2017 Chair of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM). In 2016, he received the Wilder Penfield Prix du Québec. In 2017, he was awarded the Senate of Canada 150 Medal, ranked #6 in its list of ten most influential brain scientists of the modern era by Science magazine and inducted as a Fellow of the College of Academic Health Sciences. In 2018, he was awarded the Heinz Lehmann Prize for services to Neuropsychopharmacology, the Victor Dahdaleh Chair in Neurosciences and the Club de Recherches Clinique du Québec Mentorship Prize. He was awarded the OHBM Glass Brain Award in 2019 and the Killam Prize in Health Sciences in 2020, both for lifetime achievement.

#### Holistic AI-Driven Quantification, Staging and Prognosis of COVID-19 Pneumonia

**Abstract:** Improving screening, discovering therapies, developing a vaccine and performing staging and prognosis are decisive steps in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Staging and prognosis are especially crucial for organizational anticipation (intensive-care bed availability, patient management planning) and accelerating drug development; through rapid, reproducible and quantified response-to-treatment assessment. In this letter, we report on an artificial intelligence solution for performing automatic staging and prognosis based on imaging, clinical, comorbidities and biological data. This approach relies on automatic computed tomography (CT)-based disease quantification using deep learning, robust data-driven identification of physiologically-inspired COVID19 holistic patient profiling, and strong, reproducible staging/outcome prediction with good generalization properties using an ensemble of consensus methods. Highly promising results on multiple independent external evaluation cohorts along with comparisons with expert human readers demonstrate the potentials of our approach. The developed solution offers perspectives for optimal patient management, given the shortage of intensive care beds and ventilators, along with means to assess patient response to treatment.

# MIDL FAQ on the Covid-19 pandemic

We, and the Canadian authorities, are monitoring the Covid-19 pandemic closely, and are taking steps so the event can go fully online if needed.
**In any case, the accepted papers will be published**, and the reviewing schedule is not impacted.

Since the situation is rapidly evolving, we will keep the MIDL community updated and will take any measure required to protect everyone's health and safety.

This page is an attempt to answer frequently asked questions about the issue, and to provide an updated overview of the situation, and its impact on MIDL.
For any other question, the organizers can be reached at [2020@midl.io](mailto:2020@midl.io).


## Is MIDL 2020 canceled ?
No. For now, we are operating as if MIDL 2020 will happen. The physical meeting will take place unless safety/health regulations requires that it be canceled.

Nonetheless, we understand that some might hesitate to register. **To this end we are allowing cancellations until May 1st.** A full refund (minus the credit card processing fees) will be issued upon request. We might extend the cancellation deadline as the situation evolve.


## Will the event be streamed ?
Yes, [as in the previous years](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd87UPUTt-oqTeGi8fQw-_w). The technical details are not finalized yet, but anyone will be able to watch the talks for free, from anywhere.

We are also developing remote participation options that will be effective in either a hybrid or fully virtual meeting. Many other events have been impacted and we expect to learn from their experience.


## What is the current situation in Québec, and Montréal ?
The [Québec official website](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/) is a good resource on the issue.

As of March 22 2020, the situation is under control in Québec (219 total cases, and 4 death). The government of Quebec reacted quickly when the first cases were confirmed, and imposed expansive measures to limit the spread of the virus.

<!-- While the borders are currently closed, it is not clear now for how long it'll be the case. Since MIDL 2020 is still few months away, it is impossible for now to say how it'll affect attending. -->

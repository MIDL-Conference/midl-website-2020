# MIDL FAQ on the Covid-19 pandemic

We, and the Canadian authorities, are monitoring the Covid-19 pandemic closely, and are taking steps so the event can go fully online if needed.
Since the situation is rapidly evolving, we will keep the MIDL community updated and will take any measure required to protect everyone's health and safety.

This page is an attempt to answer frequently asked questions about the issue, and to provide an updated overview of the situation, and its impact on MIDL.
For any other question, the organizers can be reached at [2020@midl.io](mailto:2020@midl.io).

## Is MIDL 2020 canceled ?
No. While we are currently moving forward as planned, we understand that some might hesitate. **To this end we are allowing cancellations until May 1st.** A full refund (minus the credit card processing fees) will be issued.


## Will the event be streamed ?
Yes, [as in the previous years](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd87UPUTt-oqTeGi8fQw-_w). The technical details are not finalized yet, but anyone will be able to watch the talks for free, from anywhere.


## What is the current situation in Québec, and Montréal ?
The [Québec official website](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/) is a good resource on the issue.

As of March 15 2020, the situation is under control (39 total cases, and 0 death). The government of Quebec reacted quickly when the first cases were confirmed, and imposed expansive measures to limit the spread of the virus. The city of Montréal went even further, closing most public facilities of the city.

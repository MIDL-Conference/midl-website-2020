<span class="paper_abstract">
        A Laplacian pyramid-based complex neural network, CLP-Net, is proposed to reconstruct high-quality magnetic resonance images from undersampled k-space data. Specifically, three major contributions have been made: 1) A new framework has been proposed to explore the encouraging multi-scale properties of Laplacian pyramid decomposition; 2) A cascaded multi-scale network architecture with complex convolutions has been designed under the proposed framework; 3) Experimental validations on an open source dataset fastMRI demonstrate the encouraging properties of the proposed method in preserving image edges and fine textures.

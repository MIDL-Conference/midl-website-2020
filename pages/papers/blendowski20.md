        "Current deep learning methods are based on the repeated, expensive application of convolutions with parameter-intensive weight matrices. In this work, we present a novel concept that enables the application of differentiable random ferns in end-to-end networks. It can then be used as multiplication-free convolutional layer alternative in deep network architectures. Our experiments on the binary classification task of the TUPAC\\'16 challenge demonstrate improved results over the state-of-the-art binary XNOR net and only slightly worse performance than its 2x more parameter intensive floating point CNN counterpart.

# Visa & travel information

## Visa
Most people need a visa **or** an Electronic Travel Authorization to travel to Canada – not both. Some people may only need their valid passport.

[List of visa-exempt countries](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/entry-requirements-country.html). You can find out if you need a visa [here](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/visas.asp.).

For those who need a visa, more information can be found on the [Canada immigration website](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/about-visitor-visa.html).
Enquiries about invitation letters or other documents can be sent to [visa@2020.midl.io](mailto:visa@2020.midl.io).

## Traveling to Montréal
The Montréal–Trudeau International Airport (IATA: YUL, ICAO: CYUL) is located on the Montréal island. Getting downtown can either be done with the [747 bus line](http://www.stm.info/en/info/networks/bus/shuttle/line-747-east) (runs every 15 minutes), or by taxi. The 747 bus line connects to both orange and green metro line at métro Lionel-Groulx, and has many other stops downtown.

## Accommodations

[Hotel Monville](https://www.hotelmonville.com) -- just across the street of the confererence venue -- offers a discounted price for MIDL participants. A discount code will be sent in the e-mail upon registration, offering a rate of 199$ (+ taxes) per night.

The venue is conveniently located on top of the Place d'armes métro station (orange line), and 10 minutes walk away from the Place des arts station (green line). Hotels and accommodations along those lines will guarantee a short commute to the conference.

## Getting around
Public transportations in Montréal are a convenient way to get around. [1-day, 3-days and weekly pass](http://www.stm.info/en/info/fares) include the 747 bus to the airport.

**Important:** weekly pass always starts on Monday. You will need a 1-day or 3-day pass if you arrive on Saturday/Sunday.

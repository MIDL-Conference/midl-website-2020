# Call for papers

## Aim and Scope

We welcome submissions, as full papers or abstracts, for the 2nd International Conference on Medical Imaging with Deep Learning. This conference is a forum for deep learning researchers, clinicians and health-care companies working at the intersection of medical image analysis and machine learning for disease detection, diagnosis, prognosis, intervention, treatment selection and monitoring of disease progression.

The conference has a broad scope including all areas of medical image analysis and computer-assisted intervention where deep learning is a key element.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

* Semantic segmentation of medical images
* Learning based image registration
* Computer-aided detection and diagnosis
* Image acquisition, reconstruction and synthesis
* Transfer learning and domain adaptation
* Learning with noisy labels and limited data
* Unsupervised deep learning and representation learning
* Uncertainty estimation for medical diagnosis
* Interpretability and explainable deep learning
* Integration of imaging and clinical data
* Validation studies and deep learning applications in radiology, pathology, endoscopy, dermatology, ophthalmology, and beyond

## Two-Track Submissions

Conference submissions follow two tracks: full conference papers and extended abstracts.
All accepted full papers will be published as a volume in the [Proceedings of Machine Learning Research](http://proceedings.mlr.press/).

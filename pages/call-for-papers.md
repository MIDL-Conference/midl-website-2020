# Call for papers

## Aim and Scope

We welcome submissions, as full or short papers, for the 3rd International Conference on Medical Imaging with Deep Learning. This conference is a forum for deep learning researchers, clinicians and health-care companies working at the intersection of medical image analysis and machine learning for disease detection, diagnosis, prognosis, intervention, treatment selection and monitoring of disease progression.

The conference has a broad scope including all areas of medical image analysis and computer-assisted intervention where deep learning is a key element.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

* Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
* Semantic segmentation of medical images
* Learning based image registration
* Computer-aided detection and diagnosis
* Image acquisition, reconstruction and synthesis
* Transfer learning and domain adaptation
* Learning with noisy labels and limited data
* Unsupervised deep learning and representation learning
* Uncertainty estimation for medical diagnosis
* Interpretability and explainable deep learning
* Integration of imaging and clinical data
* Validation studies and deep learning applications in radiology, pathology, endoscopy, dermatology, ophthalmology, and beyond

## Two-Track Submissions

Conference submissions follow two tracks: full conference papers and short papers. Full papers contain well-validated applications or methodological developments of deep learning algorithms in medical imaging. There is no strict limit on paper length. However, we strongly recommend keeping the paper at 8 pages, plus 1 page for the references and as many pages as needed in an appendix section (all in a single pdf). The appropriateness of using additional pages over the recommended length will be judged by reviewers. These papers will go through a full, double-blind reviewing process via OpenReview. A selection of these papers will be invited for oral presentation, whereas the rest will be assigned a poster presentation. All accepted full papers will be published as a volume in the [Proceedings of Machine Learning Research](http://proceedings.mlr.press/).

Short papers are up to 3 pages and can, for example, focus on novel methodological ideas without extensive validation. We also specifically accept short papers discussing recently published or submitted journal contributions to give authors the opportunity to present their work and obtain feedback from conference attendees. Selection of short papers is performed via a light single-blind review process and they will be presented as posters at the conference.

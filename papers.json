        "abstract": "We propose a novel weakly supervised learning segmentation based on several global constraints derived from box annotations. Particularly, we leverage a classical tightness prior to a deep learning setting via imposing a set of constraints on the network outputs. Such a powerful topological prior prevents solutions from excessive shrinking by enforcing any horizontal or vertical line within the bounding box to contain, at least, one pixel of the foreground region. Furthermore, we integrate our deep tightness prior with a global background emptiness constraint, guiding training with information outside the bounding box. We demonstrate experimentally that such a global constraint is much more powerful than standard cross-entropy for the background class. Our optimization problem is challenging as it takes the form of a large set of inequality constraints on the outputs of deep networks. We solve it with sequence of unconstrained losses based on a recent powerful extension of the log-barrier method, which is well-known in the context of interior-point methods. This accommodates standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for training deep networks, while avoiding computationally expensive and unstable Lagrangian dual steps and projections. Extensive experiments over two different public data sets and applications (prostate and brain lesions) demonstrate that the synergy between our global tightness and emptiness priors yield very competitive performances, approaching full supervision and outperforming significantly DeepCut. Furthermore, our approach removes the need for computationally expensive proposal generation. Our code is shared anonymously.   ",

In PDI, such CNN is firstly trained on healthy subjects' data with labels by maximizing the posterior Gaussian distribution loss function as used in Bayesian deep learning. When testing on each patient' data without any label, PDI updates the pre-trained CNN's weights in an unsupervised fashion by minimizing the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence between the approximated posterior distribution represented by CNN and the true posterior distribution given the likelihood distribution from known physical model and pre-defined prior distribution.

        "abstract": "Deep learning networks are being developed in every stage of the MRI workflow and have provided state-of-the-art results. However, this has come at the cost of increased computation requirement and storage. Hence, replacing the networks with compact models at various stages in the MRI workflow can significantly reduce the required storage space and provide considerable speedup. In computer vision, knowledge distillation is a commonly used method for model compression. In our work, we propose a knowledge distillation (KD) framework for the image to image problems in the MRI workflow in order to develop compact, low-parameter models without a significant drop in performance. We propose a combination of the attention-based feature distillation method and imitation loss and demonstrate its effectiveness on the popular MRI reconstruction architecture, DC-CNN. We conduct extensive experiments using Cardiac, Brain, and Knee MRI datasets for 4x, 5x and 8x accelerations. We observed that the student network trained with the assistance of the teacher using our proposed KD framework provided significant improvement over the student network trained without assistance across all the datasets and acceleration factors. Specifically, for the Knee dataset, the student network achieves $65\\%$ parameter reduction, 2x faster CPU running time, and 1.5x faster GPU running time compared to the teacher. Furthermore, we compare our attention-based feature distillation method with other feature distillation methods. We also conduct an ablative study to understand the significance of attention-based distillation and imitation loss. We also extend our KD framework for MRI super-resolution and show encouraging results. ",

An approximating neural network provides synthetic gradients (SG) for backpropagation across a non-differentiable module.  Our design is grounded on a well-known theory that gradient of an approximating neural network can approximate a sub-gradient of a weakly differentiable function.

        "abstract": "Segmentation of cell nuclei in microscopy images is a prevalent necessity in cell biology.\n      Especially for three-dimensional datasets, manual segmentation is prohibitively time-consuming, motivating the need for automated methods. Learning-based methods trained on pixel-wise ground-truth segmentations have been shown to yield state-of-the-art results on 2d benchmark image data of nuclei, yet a respective benchmark is missing for 3d image data. In this work, we perform a comparative evaluation of nuclei segmentation algorithms on a database of manually segmented 3d light microscopy volumes. We propose a novel learning strategy that boosts segmentation accuracy by means of a simple auxiliary task, thereby robustly outperforming each of our baselines. Furthermore, we show that one of our baselines, the popular three-label model, when trained with our proposed auxiliary task, outperforms the recent StarDist-3D.\n      As an additional, practical contribution, we benchmark nuclei segmentation against nuclei detection, i.e. the task of merely pinpointing individual nuclei without generating respective pixel-accurate segmentations. For learning nuclei detection, large 3d training datasets of manually annotated nuclei center points are available. However, the impact on detection accuracy caused by training on such sparse ground truth as opposed to dense pixel-wise ground truth has not yet been quantified. To this end, we compare nuclei detection accuracy yielded by training on dense vs. sparse ground truth. Our results suggest that training on sparse ground truth yields competitive nuclei detection rates. ",

However, it has been mostly studied under a single sequence scenario, despite the fact that multi-sequence MR scan is common in practice. In this paper, we aim to optimize multi-sequence MR image recovery from undersampled k-space data under an overall time constraint while considering the difference in acquisition time for various sequences. We first formulate it as a constrained optimization problem and then show that finding the optimal sampling strategy for all sequences and the best recovery model at the same time is combinatorial and hence computationally prohibitive. To solve this problem, we propose a blind recovery model that simultaneously recovers multiple sequences, and an efficient approach to find proper combination of sampling strategy and recovery model. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms sequence-wise recovery, and sheds light on how to decide the undersampling strategy for sequences within an overall time budget.",

In another setting (semi-supervised), the auxiliary segmentation ground truth is used during training.

The whole architecture is trained end-to-end with input being an RGB-like image formed by stacking 3 different viewing windows of a single slice. We validate the method on the recent RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection challenge and on the CQ500 dataset. For the RSNA challenge, our best single model achieves a weighted log loss of 0.0529 on the leaderboard, which is comparable to the top 3\\% performances, almost all of which make use of ensemble learning. Importantly, our method generalizes very well: the model trained on the RSNA dataset significantly outperforms the 2D model, which does not take into account the relationship between slices, on CQ500.

We explored a deep learning model to detect PE on volumetric contrast-enhanced chest CT scans using a 2-stage training strategy. First, a residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) was trained using annotated 2D images. In addition to the classification loss, an attention loss was added during training to help the network focus attention on PE. Next, a recurrent network was used to scan sequentially through the features provided by the pre-trained ResNet to detect PE. This combination allows the network to be trained using both a limited and sparse set of pixel-level annotated images and a large number of easily obtainable patient-level image-label pairs. We used 1,670 sparsely annotated studies and more than 10,000 labeled studies in our training. On a test set with 2,160 patient studies, the proposed method achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.812. The proposed framework is also able to provide localized attention maps that indicate possible PE lesions, which could potentially help radiologists accelerate the diagnostic process.",

We highlight that due to the generative nature of our model we can also incorporate unlabeled data from known or previously unseen domains. To the best of our knowledge this has not been done before in a domain generalization setting. This property is highly desirable in fields like medical imaging where labeled data is scarce.

We propose a class of loss functions, which encourage direct kernel density matching in the network-output space, up to some geometric transformations computed from unlabeled inputs. Rather than using an intermediate domain discriminator, our direct approach unifies distribution matching and segmentation in a single loss. Therefore, it simplifies segmentation adaptation by avoiding extra adversarial steps, while improving quality, stability and efficiency of training. We juxtapose our approach to state-of-the-art segmentation adaptation via adversarial training in the network-output space.

        "abstract": "Deep learning has proven to be an essential tool for medical image analysis.  However, the need for accurately labeled input data, often requiring time- and labor-intensive annotation by experts, is a major limitation to the use of deep learning.  One solution to this challenge is to allow for use of coarse or noisy labels, which could permit more efficient and scalable labeling of images.  In this work, we develop a lopsided loss function based on entropy regularization that assumes the existence of a nontrivial false negative rate in the target annotations.  Starting with a carefully annotated brain metastasis lesion dataset, we simulate data with false negatives by (1) randomly censoring the annotated lesions and (2) systematically censoring the smallest lesions.  The latter better models true physician error because smaller lesions are harder to notice than the larger ones.  Even with a simulated false negative rate as high as 50%, applying our loss function to randomly censored data preserves maximum sensitivity at 97% of the baseline with uncensored training data, compared to just 10% for a standard loss function.  For the size-based censorship, performance is restored from 17% with the current standard to 88% with our lopsided bootstrap loss.  Our work will enable more efficient scaling of the image labeling process, in parallel with other approaches on creating more efficient user interfaces and tools for annotation.",

        "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of spine Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is highly demanded in morphological research, quantitative analysis, and diseases identification, such as spinal canal stenosis, disc herniation and degeneration. However, accurate spine segmentation is challenging because of the irregular shape, artifacts and large variability between slices. To alleviate these problems, spatial information is used for more continuous and accurate segmentation such as by 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) . However, 3D CNN suffers from higher computational cost, memory cost and risk of over-fitting, especially for medical images where the number of labeled data is limited. To address these problems, we apply the attention mechanism for the utilization of inter-slice information in 3D segmentation tasks based on 2D convolutional networks and propose a spatial attention-based densely connected U-Net (SAU-Net), which consists of Dense U-Net for extraction of intra-slice features and an inter-slice attention module (ISA) to utilize inter-slice information from adjacent slices and refine the segmentation results. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ISA as well as higher accuracy and efficiency of segmentation results of our method compared with other deep learning methods.",

        "abstract": "Convolutional Neural network based MR reconstruction methods have shown to provide fast and high quality reconstructions.  A primary drawback with a CNN-based model is that it lacks flexibility and can effectively operate only for a specific acquisition context limiting practical applicability.  By acquisition context, we mean a specific combination of three input settings considered namely, the anatomy under study, undersampling mask pattern and acceleration  factor  for  undersampling.   The  model  could be  trained  jointly  on  images  combining multiple contexts.  However the model does not meet the performance of context specific models nor extensible to contexts unseen at train time.  This necessitates a modification to the existing architecture in generating context specific weights so as to incorporate flexibility to multiple contexts. We propose a multiple acquisition context based network, called MAC-ReconNet for MRI reconstruction, flexible to multiple acquisition contexts and generalizable to unseen contexts for applicability in real scenarios. The proposed network has an MRI reconstruction module and a dynamic weight prediction (DWP) module.  The DWP module takes the corresponding acquisition context information  as  input  and  learns  the context-specific weights  of  the  reconstruction module which changes dynamically with context at run time.  We show that the proposed approach can handle multiple contexts  based on Cardiac and Brain datasets, Gaussian and Cartesian undersampling patterns and five acceleration factors. The proposed network outperforms the naive  jointly  trained model  and  gives  competitive results  with  the  context-specific  models both quantitatively and qualitatively.  We also demonstrate the generalizability of our model by testing on contexts unseen at train time.",

Conventionally, such map is produced in three independent steps: 1) gene-clustering to metagenes, 2) image feature extraction, and 3) statistical correlation between metagenes and image features. Each step is separately performed and relies on arbitrary measurements without considering the correlation among each other. In this work, we investigate the potential of an end-to-end method fusing gene code with image features to generate synthetic pathology image and learn radiogenomic map simultaneously. To achieve this goal, we develop a multi-conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) conditioned on both background images and gene expression code, synthesizing the corresponding image. Image and gene features are fused at different scales to ensure both the separation of pathology part and background, as well as the realism and quality of the synthesized image. We tested our method on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed method produces realistic synthetic images, and provides a promising way to find gene-image relationship in a holistic end-to-end manner.",

A combination of Fourier space (F) and/or image domain (I) U-nets and W-nets were trained with a multi-scale structural similarity and mean absolute error loss function to denoise filtered back projected (FBP) LDCT images while maintaining perceptual features important for diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning enhancements were superior to FBP LDCT images in quantitative and qualitative performance with the dual-domain W-nets outperforming single-domain U-net cascades.

The introduction of MINE tackles some of the drawbacks of histogram based MI computation and matrix exponential makes the optimization process smoother. We also introduce the idea of a multi-resolution loss, which makes the optimization process faster and more robust.

        "abstract": "We present a deep learning strategy for contrast-agnostic semantic segmentation of unpreprocessed brain MRI scans, without requiring additional training or fine-tuning for new modalities. Classical Bayesian methods address this segmentation problem with unsupervised intensity models, but require significant computational resources. In contrast, learning-based methods can be fast at test time, but are sensitive to the data available at training. Our proposed learning method, SynthSeg, leverages a set of training segmentations (no intensity images required) to generate synthetic scans of widely varying contrasts on the fly during training. These scans are produced using the generative model of the classical Bayesian segmentation framework, with randomly sampled parameters for appearance, deformation, noise, and bias field. Because each mini-batch has a different synthetic contrast, the final network is not biased towards any specific MRI contrast. We comprehensively evaluate our approach on four datasets comprising over 1,000 subjects and four MR contrasts. The results show that our approach successfully segments every contrast in the data, performing slightly better than classical Bayesian segmentation, and three orders of magnitude faster. Moreover, even within the same type of MRI contrast, our strategy generalizes significantly better across datasets, compared to training using real images. Finally, we find that synthesizing a broad range of contrasts, even if unrealistic, increases the generalization of the neural network.

For this purpose, we design a recurrent multi-encoder-decoder architecture for processing 4D data.

However, due to the black box nature of deep learning, the best method may fail in some situations. Thus predicting segmentation quality without ground truth would be very crucial especially in clinical practice. Recently, people proposed to train neural networks to estimate the quality score by regression. Although it can achieve promising prediction accuracy, the network suffers robustness problem, e.g. it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose to alleviate this problem by utilizing the difference between the input image and the reconstructed image, which is conditioned on the segmentation to be assessed, to lower the chance to overfit to the undesired image features  from the original input image, and thus to increase the robustness.

Building on the recent interest in tensor networks for machine learning, we extend the Matrix Product State tensor networks (which can be interpreted as linear classifiers operating in exponentially high dimensional spaces) to be useful in medical image analysis tasks. We focus on classification problems as a first step where we motivate the use of tensor networks and propose adaptions for 2D images using classical image domain concepts such as local orderlessness of images. With the proposed locally orderless tensor network model (LoTeNet), we show that tensor networks are capable of attaining performance that is comparable to state-of-the-art deep learning methods. We evaluate the model on two publicly available medical imaging datasets and show performance improvements with fewer model hyperparameters and lesser computational resources compared to relevant baseline methods.",

For this purpose, we extend Neural Image Compression (NIC), an image compression framework that reduces the dimensionality of these images using an encoder network trained unsupervisedly.

First, we obtained state-of-the-art results in the Tumor Proliferation Assessment Challenge of 2016 (TUPAC16). Second, we successfully classified histopathological growth patterns in images with colorectal liver metastasis (CLM). Third, we predicted patient risk of death by learning directly from overall survival in the same CLM data. Our experimental results suggest that the representations learned by the MTL objective are: (1) highly specific, due to the supervised training signal, and (2) transferable, since the same features perform well across different tasks. Additionally, we trained multiple encoders with different training objectives, e.g. unsupervised and variants of MTL, and observed a positive correlation between the number of tasks in MTL and the system performance on the TUPAC16 dataset.",

Since mutual information does not require a strict ordering of clusters in two different cluster assignments, we propose to incorporate another consistency regularization loss which forces the alignment of class probabilities at each pixel of perturbed unlabeled images. We evaluate the method on three challenging publicly-available medical datasets for image segmentation. Experimental results show our method to outperform recently-proposed approaches for semi-supervised and yield a performance comparable to fully-supervised training.",

Their applications in the clinical setting are, however, limited due to the lack of trustworthiness and reliability. Selective image segmentation has been proposed to address this issue by letting a DNN model process instances with high confidence while referring difficult ones with high uncertainty to experienced radiologists. As such, the model performance is only affected by the predictions on the high confidence subset rather than the whole dataset. Existing selective segmentation methods, however, ignore this unique property of selective segmentation and train their DNN models by optimizing accuracy on the entire dataset. Motivated by such a discrepancy, we present a novel method in this paper that considers such uncertainty in the training process to maximize the accuracy on the confident subset rather than the accuracy on the whole dataset. Experimental results using the whole heart and great vessel segmentation and gland segmentation show that such a training scheme can significantly improve the performance of selective segmentation.

These models are often trained with heavy supervision, relying on pairs of images and corresponding voxel-level labels. However, obtaining segmentations of anatomical regions on a large number of cases can be prohibitively expensive. Thus there is a strong need for deep learning-based segmentation tools that do not require heavy supervision and can continuously adapt. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective of segmentation as a discrete representation learning problem, and present a variational autoencoder segmentation strategy that is flexible and adaptive. Our method, called Segmentation Auto-Encoder (SAE), leverages all available unlabeled scans and merely requires a segmentation prior, which can be a single unpaired segmentation image. In experiments, we apply SAE to brain MRI scans. Our results show that SAE can produce good quality segmentations, particularly when the prior is good. We demonstrate that a Markov Random Field prior can yield significantly better results than a spatially independent prior. Our code is freely available at https://github.com/evanmy/sae. ",

        "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a widely-accepted imaging technique for knee injury analysis. Its advantage of capturing knee structure in three dimensions makes it the ideal tool for radiologists to locate potential tears in the knee. In order to better confront the ever growing workload of musculoskeletal (MSK) radiologists, automated tools for patients' triage are becoming a real need, reducing delays in the reading of pathological cases. In this work, we present the Efficiently-Layered Network (ELNet), a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture optimized for the task of initial knee MRI diagnosis for triage. Unlike past approaches, we train ELNet from scratch instead of using a transfer-learning approach. The proposed method is validated quantitatively and qualitatively, and compares favorably against state-of-the-art MRNet while using a single imaging stack (axial or coronal) as input. Additionally, we demonstrate our model's capability to locate tears in the knee despite the absence of localization information during training. Lastly, the proposed model is extremely lightweight ($<$ 1MB) and therefore easy to train and deploy in real clinical settings.",

On one side of our model is a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained to learn the latent representations of cardiac shapes.  On the other side is a GAN that uses  \u201dSPatially-Adaptive (DE)Normalization\u201d (SPADE) modules to generate realistic MR images tailored to a given anatomical map.  At test time, the sampling of the VAE latent space allows to generate an arbitrary large number of cardiac shapes, which are fed to the GAN that subsequently generates MR images whose cardiac structure fits that of the cardiac shapes.  In other words, our system can generate a large volume of realistic yet labeled cardiac MR images.  We show that segmentation with CNNs trained with our synthetic annotated images gets competitive results compared to traditional techniques.\n      We also show that combining data augmentation with our GAN-generated images lead to an improvement in the Dice score of up to 12 percent while allowing for better generalization capabilities on  other datasets.",

In contrast to current solutions based on exhaustive search or region proposals, which require large amounts of annotated data, we propose a deep reinforcement learning approach for organ localization in CT. In this work, an artificial agent is actively self-taught to localize organs in CT by learning from its asserts and mistakes. Within the context of reinforcement learning, we propose a novel set of actions tailored for organ localization in CT. Our method can use as a plug-and-play module for localizing any organ of interest. We evaluate the proposed solution on the public VISCERAL dataset containing CT scans with varying fields of view and multiple organs.

        "abstract": "Multimodal image registration is a very challenging problem for deep learning approaches. Most current work focuses on either supervised learning that requires labelled training scans and may yield models that bias towards annotated structures or unsupervised approaches that are based on hand-crafted similarity metrics and may therefore not outperform their classical non-trained counterparts. We believe that unsupervised domain adaptation can be beneficial in overcoming the current limitations for multimodal registration, where good metrics are hard to define.\n      Domain adaptation has so far been mainly limited to classification problems. We propose the first use of unsupervised domain adaptation for discrete multimodal registration. Based on a source domain for which quantised displacement labels are available as supervision, we transfer the output distribution of the network to better resemble the target domain (other modality) using classifier discrepancies. To improve upon the sliced Wasserstein metric for 2D histograms, we present a novel approximation that projects predictions into 1D and computes the L1 distance of their cumulative sums. Our proof-of-concept demonstrates the applicability of domain transfer from mono- to multimodal 2D registration of canine MRI scans and improves the registration accuracy from 33% (using sliced Wasserstein) to 44%.",

However, this segmentation is challenging due to high variability across subjects and the potential lack of contrast between structures. Then, the main objective of this work is to develop an accurate automatic segmentation method based on deep learning models for the myocardial borders on LGE-MRI. To this end, 2.5 D residual neural network integrated with a squeeze and excitation blocks in encoder side with specialized convolutional has been proposed. Late fusion has been used to merge the output of the best trained proposed models from a different set of hyperparameters. A total number of 320 exams (with a mean number of 6 slices per exam) were used for training and 28 exams used for testing. The performance analysis of the proposed ensemble model in the basal and middle slices was similar as compared to intra-observer study and slightly lower at apical slices. The overall Dice score was 82.01% by our proposed method as compared to Dice score of 83.22% obtained from the intra observer study. The proposed model could be used for the automatic segmentation of myocardial border that is a very important step for accurate quantification of no-reflow, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, among others.",

The lack of extensive/publicly available annotations presented a key challenge, as large amounts of labeled data are typically required for training sensitive models with deep learning. To address this, we: (i) generated preliminary tissue labels using the Draw-EM algorithm, which uses Expectation-Maximization and was originally designed for tissue segmentation in the neonatal domain; and (ii) employed a human-in-the-loop approach, whereby an expert fetal imaging annotator assessed and refined the performance of the model. By using a hybrid approach that combined automatically generated labels with manual refinements by an expert, we amplified the utility of ground truth annotations while immensely reducing their cost (283 slices). The deep learning system was developed, refined, and validated on 249 3D T2-weighted scans obtained from the Developing Human Connectome Project's fetal cohort, acquired at 3T. Analysis of the system showed that it is invariant to gestational age at scan, as it generalized well to a wide age range (21 \u2013 38 weeks) despite variations in cortical morphology and intensity  across the fetal distribution. It was also found to be invariant to intensities in regions surrounding the brain (amniotic fluid), which often present a major obstacle to the processing of neuroimaging data in the fetal domain.

We compare its performance to related and more prevalent approaches, such as deep ensembles, on the task of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. To this end, we evaluate models, trained to discriminate normal lymph node tissue from breast cancer metastases, on lymph nodes containing lymphoma. We show the ability to discriminate between the in-distribution lymph node tissue and lymphoma by evaluating the AUROC based on the uncertainty signal. Here, the best performing multi-head CNN (91.7) outperforms both Monte Carlo dropout (86.5) and deep ensembles (86.8).

In recent years, convolutional neural networks have dominated the state of the art in this task. However, since this problem presents a challenging environment due to high variability in the organ's shape and similarity between tissues, the generation of false negative and false positive regions in the output segmentation is a common issue. Recent works have shown that the uncertainty analysis of the model can provide us with useful information about potential errors in the segmentation. In this context, we proposed a segmentation refinement method based on uncertainty analysis and graph convolutional networks. We employ the uncertainty levels of the convolutional network in a particular input volume to formulate a semi-supervised graph learning problem that is solved by training a graph convolutional network. To test our method we refine the initial output of a 2D U-Net. We validate our framework with the NIH pancreas dataset and the spleen dataset of the medical segmentation decathlon. We show that our method outperforms the state-of-the art CRF refinement method by improving the dice score by 1% for the pancreas and 2% for spleen, with respect to the original U-Net's prediction.

This is especially true for applications where large deformations exist, such as registration of interpatient abdominal MRI or inhale-to-exhale CT lung registra- tion. Most current works use U-Net-like architectures to predict dense displacement fields from the input images in different supervised and unsupervised settings. We believe that the U-Net architecture itself to some level limits the ability to predict large deformations (even when using multilevel strategies) and therefore propose a novel approach, where the input images are mapped into a displacement space and final registrations are reconstructed from this embedding. Experiments on inhale-to-exhale CT lung registration demonstrate the ability of our architecture to predict large deformations in a single forward path through our network (leading to errors below 2 mm).",

Training a deep model to detect out-of-body and non-relevant segments in surgical videos requires suitable labeling. Since annotating surgical videos with per-second relevancy labeling is a tedious task, our proposed framework initiates the learning process from a weakly labeled noisy dataset and iteratively applies Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) to re-annotate the training data samples. Evaluating our model, on an independent test set, shows a mean detection accuracy of above 97% after several training-annotating iterations. Since our final goal is achieving out-of-body segments detection for anonymization, we evaluate our ability to detect these segments at a high demanding recall of 97%, which leads to a precision of 83.5%. We believe this approach can be applied to similar related medical problems, in which only a coarse set of relevancy labels exists, currently limiting the possibility for supervision training.",

        "abstract": "In breast cancer screening, radiologists make the diagnosis based on images that are taken from two angles. Inspired by this, we seek to improve the performance of deep neural networks applied to this task by encouraging the model to use information from both views of the breast. First, we take a closer look at the training process and observe an imbalance between learning from the two views. In particular, we observe that parameters of the layers processing one of the views have larger gradient norms and contribute more to the overall loss reduction. Next, we test several methods targeted at utilizing both views more equally in training. We find that using the same weights to process both views, or using a technique called modality dropout, leads to a boost in performance. Looking forward, our results indicate improving learning dynamics as a promising avenue for improving utilization of multiple views in deep neural networks for medical diagnosis.",

However, reading retinal images is a difficult and time-consuming task even for experienced specialists. The fundamental step towards automated retinal image analysis is vessel segmentation and artery/vein classification, which provide various information on potential disorders. To improve the performance of the existing automated methods for retinal image analysis, we propose a two-step vessel classification. We adopt a UNet-based model, SeqNet, to accurately segment vessels from the background and make prediction on the vessel type. Our model does segmentation and classification sequentially, which alleviates the problem of label distribution bias and facilitates training. To further refine classification results, we post-process them considering the structural information among vessels to propagate highly confident prediction to surrounding vessels. Our experiments show that our method improves AUC to 0.98 for segmentation and the accuracy to 0.92 in classification over DRIVE dataset.",

        "abstract": "Quality control (QC) of medical images is essential to ensure that downstream analyses such as segmentation can be performed successfully. Currently, QC is predominantly performed visually at significant time and operator cost. We aim to automate the process by formulating a probabilistic network that estimates uncertainty through a heteroscedastic noise model, hence providing a proxy measure of task-specific image quality that is learnt directly from the data. By augmenting the training data with different types of simulated k-space artefacts, we propose a novel cascading CNN architecture based on a student-teacher framework with a weighted adaptive task loss to decouple sources of uncertainty related to different k-space augmentations in an entirely self-supervised manner. This enables us to predict separate uncertainty quantities for the different types of data degradation. While the uncertainty measures reflect the presence and severity of image artefacts, the network also provides the segmentation predictions given the quality of the data. We show that models trained with simulated artefacts provide more informative measures of uncertainty on real-world images and we validate our uncertainty predictions on problematic images identified by human-raters.",

        "abstract": "Retinal microaneurysms (MAs) are the earliest signs of diabetic retinopathy (DR) which is  the  leading  cause  of  blindness  in  the  western  world.   MAs  independently  predict  the risk of sight threatening DR and early detection is important to identify patients at risk. Detection and segmentation of retinal MAs present a particular challenging problem due to  a  large  class  imbalance  with  MA  pixels  accounting  for  less  than  0.5%  of  the  retinal image.  Extreme foreground-background class imbalance can adversely affect the learning process in DNNs by introducing a bias towards the most well represented class.  Recently, a number of objective functions have been proposed as alternatives to the standard Crossentropy loss in efforts to overcome this problem.  In this work we investigate the influence of  the  network  objective  during  optimization  by  comparing  Residual  U-nets  trained  for segmentation of MAs in retinal images using seven different objective functions; weighted and unweighted Crossentropy loss, Dice loss, weighted and unweighted Focal loss, Focal Dice loss and Focal Tversky loss.  Three networks with different seeds are trained for each objective function using optimized hyper-parameter settings on a dataset of 382 images with pixel level annotations for MAs.  The instance level MA detection performance is evaluated as the average free response receiver operator characteristic (FROC) score calculated as the mean sensitivity at seven average false positives (FPAvg) per image thresholds on 80 test images.  The image level MA detection performance is evaluated as the average AUC on the same images as well as a separate test set of 1200 images.  Segmentation performance is  evaluated  as  the  average  pixel  precision  (AP).  The  unweighted  Crossentropy  loss  and Focal loss outperforms all other losses for instance level detection achieving FROC scores of  0.5067(\u00b10.0115)  and  0.5062(\u00b10.0045.   The  Focal  loss  has  the  highest  pixel  precision with an AP of 0.4254(\u00b10.0096).  For image level detection both objective functions in their unweighted form perform significantly better compared to using all other objectives.  AUCs of 0.9450(\u00b10.0080) and 0.8351(\u00b10.0039) on the two test are achieved using the unweighted Crossentropy  loss,  while  AUCs  for  the  unweighted  Focal  loss  was  0.9375(\u00b10.0074)  and 0.8253(\u00b10.0042) respectivly.\n      Conclusion:\n      Despite the promise of using training objectives designed to deal with unbalanced data, the standard Crossentropy loss perform at least as well or better than all other objective functions in our experiments for lesion level and image level detection for small  retinal  MAs.   While  a  number  of  newer  objective  functions  have  been  introduced and shown to improve performance for unbalanced datasets compared to the Dice loss in recent years, our results suggest that it is important to also benchmark new losses against the Crossentropy or Focal loss function, as we achieve the best performance in all our test using these objectives.",

However, the manual detection is time-consuming and laborious, and the previous studies for the automatic detection could not achieve the accuracy and robustness for clinical application. In this work, based on the Faster R-CNN, we propose a novel method for more accurate skull fracture detection results, and we name it as the Skull R-CNN. Guiding by the morphological features of the skull, a skeleton-based region proposal method is proposed to make candidate boxes more concentrated in key regions and reduced invalid boxes. With this advantage, the region proposal network in Faster R-CNN is removed for less computation. On the other hand, a novel full resolution feature network is constructed to obtain more precise features to make the model more snesetive to small objects. Experiment results showed that most of skull fractures could be detected correctly by the proposed method in a short time. Compared to the previous works on the skull fracture detecion, Skull R-CNN significantly reduces the less false positives, and keeps a high sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) enables the simultaneous quantification of multiple properties of biological tissues. It relies on a pseudo-random acquisition and the matching of acquired signal evolutions to a precomputed dictionary. However, the dictionary is not scalable to higher-parametric spaces, limiting MRF to the simultaneous mapping of only a small number of parameters (proton density, T1 and T2 in general). Inspired by diffusion-weighted SSFP imaging, we present a proof-of-concept of a novel MRF sequence with embedded diffusion-encoding gradients along all three axes to efficiently encode orientational diffusion and T1 and T2 relaxation. We take advantage of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to reconstruct multiple quantitative maps from this single, highly undersampled acquisition. We bypass expensive dictionary matching by learning the implicit physical relationships between the spatiotemporal MRF data and the T1, T2 and diffusion tensor parameters. The predicted parameter maps and the derived scalar diffusion metrics agree well with state-of-the-art reference protocols. Orientational diffusion information is captured as seen from the estimated primary diffusion directions. In addition to this, the joint acquisition and reconstruction framework proves capable of preserving tissue abnormalities in multiple sclerosis lesions.",

        "abstract": "Geometric deep learning methods such as graph convolutional networks have recently proven to deliver generalized solutions in disease prediction using medical imaging. In this paper, we focus particularly on their use in autism classification. Most of the recent methods use graphs to leverage phenotypic information about subjects (patients or healthy controls) as additional contextual information. To do so, metadata such as age, gender and acquisition sites are utilized to define intricate relations (edges) between the subjects. We alleviate the use of such non-imaging metadata and propose a fully imaging-based approach where information from structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data are fused to construct the edges and nodes of the graph. To characterize each subject, we employ brain summaries. These are 3D images obtained from the 4D spatiotemporal resting-state fMRI data through summarization of the temporal activity of each voxel using neuroscientifically informed temporal measures such as amplitude low frequency fluctuations and entropy. Further, to extract features from these 3D brain summaries, we propose a 3D CNN model. We perform analysis on the open dataset for autism research (full ABIDE I-II) and show that by using simple brain summary measures and incorporating sMRI information, there is a noticeable increase in the generalizability and performance values of the framework as compared to state-of-the-art graph-based models.",

In order to cope with the increasing diagnostic case numbers due to the current growth and demographic change of the global population and the progress in personalized medicine, pathologists ask for assistance. Profiting from digital pathology and the use of artificial intelligence, individual solutions can be offered (e.g. to detect labeled cancer tissue sections). The testing of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) oncogene amplification status via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is recommended for breast and gastric cancer diagnostics and is regularly performed at clinics. Here, we developed a comprehensible, multi-step deep learning-based pipeline which automates the evaluation of FISH images with respect to HER2 gene amplification testing. It mimics the pathological assessment and relies on the detection and localization of interphase nuclei based on instance segmentation networks. Furthermore, it localizes and classifies fluorescence signals within each nucleus with the help of image classification and object detection convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Finally, the pipeline classifies the whole image regarding its HER2 amplification status. The visualization of pixels on which the networks' decision occurs, complements an essential part to enable interpretability by pathologists.",

        "abstract": "Recently, joint registration and segmentation has been formulated in a deep learning setting, by the definition of joint loss functions. In this work, we investigate joining these tasks at the architectural level. We propose a registration network that integrates segmentation propagation between images, and a segmentation network to predict the segmentation directly. These networks are connected into a single joint architecture via so-called cross- stitch units, allowing information to be exchanged between the tasks in a learnable manner. The proposed method is evaluated in the context of adaptive image-guided radiotherapy, using daily prostate CT imaging. Two datasets from different institutes and manufacturers were involved in the study. The first dataset was used for training (12 patients) and validation (6 patients), while the second dataset was used as an independent test set (14 patients). In terms of mean surface distance, our approach achieved 1.06 \u00b1 0.3 mm, 0.91 \u00b1 0.4 mm, 1.27 \u00b1 0.4 mm, and 1.76 \u00b1 0.8 mm on the validation set and 1.82 \u00b1 2.4 mm, 2.45 \u00b1 2.4 mm, 2.45 \u00b1 5.0 mm, and 2.57 \u00b1 2.3 mm on the test set for the prostate, bladder, seminal vesicles, and rectum, respectively. The proposed multi-task network outperformed single-task networks, as well as a network only joined through the loss function, thus demonstrating the capability to leverage the individual strengths of the segmentation and registration tasks. The obtained performance as well as the inference speed make this a promising candidate for daily re-contouring in adaptive radiotherapy, potentially reducing treatment-related side effects and improving quality-of-life after treatment.",

In this paper, we propose an automatic segmentation of Head and Neck (H&N) tumors and nodal metastases from FDG-PET and CT images. A fully-convolutional network (2D and 3D V-Net) is trained on PET-CT images using ground truth ROIs that were manually delineated by radiation oncologists for 202 patients. The results show the complementarity of the two modalities with a statistically significant improvement from 48.7% and 58.2% Dice Score Coefficients (DSC) with CT- and PET-only segmentation respectively, to 60.6% with a bimodal late fusion approach. We also note that, on this task, a 2D implementation slightly outperforms a similar 3D design (60.6% vs 59.7% for the best results respectively). The data is publicly available and the code will be shared on our GitHub repository.",

        "abstract": "The measurement of fetal head circumference (HC) is performed throughout the pregnancy as a key biometric to monitor fetus growth. This measurement is performed on ultrasound images, via the manual fitting of an ellipse. The operation is operator-dependent and as such prone to intra and inter-variability error. There have been attempts to design automated segmentation algorithms to segment fetal head, especially based on deep encoding-decoding architectures. In this paper, we depart from this idea and propose to leverage the ability of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to directly measure the head circumference, without having to resort to handcrafted features or manually labeled segmented images. The intuition behind this idea is that the CNN will  learn itself to localize and identify the head contour. Our approach is experimented on the public HC18 dataset, that contains images of all trimesters of the pregnancy. We investigate various architectures and three losses suitable for regression. While room for improvement is left, encouraging results show that it might be possible in the future to directly estimate the HC - without the need for a large dataset of manually segmented ultrasound images. This approach might be extended to other applications where segmentation is just an intermediate step to the computation of biomarkers.",

        "abstract": "Brain damage, particularly of cerebral white matter (WM), observed in premature infants in the neonatal period is responsible for frequent neurodevelopmental sequelae in early childhood and [V Pierrat et al. EPIPAGE-2 cohort study. BMJ. 2017]. Punctuate white matter lesions (PWML) are most frequent WM abnormalities, occurring in 18\u201335% of all preterm infants [AL Nguyen et al. Int Journal of Developmental Neuroscience, 2019] [N. Tusor et al, Scientific Reports, 2017].\n\n      Accurately assessing the volume and localisation of these lesions at the early postnatal phase can help paediatricians adapting the therapeutic strategy and potentially reduce severe sequelae. MRI is the gold standard neuroimaging tool to assess minimal to severe WM lesions, but it is only rarely performed for cost and accessibility reasons. Cranial ultrasonography (cUS) is a routinely used tool, however, the visual detection of PWM lesions  is challenging and time consuming because these lesions are small with variable contrast and no specific pattern. There are also weak anatomical landmarks in neonate brains as the brain structures are moving and not fully developed.\n\n      Research on automatic detection of PWML on MRI based on standard image analysis was initiated by Mukherjee [Mukherjee, S. et al. MBEC 57(1), 71-87, 2019]. One other team has recently tackled this issue based on deep architectures [Y Liu et al. MICCAI 2019]. Despite the high contrast and low noise of MR images, this algorithm struggles with low accuracy over the PWML detection task. As far as we know, there is currently no known research team working on automatic segmentation of PWML on US data. This task is highly challenging because of the speckle noise, low contrast and the high acquisition variability.\n\n      In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture based on the U-Net backbone to perform the detection and segmentation of PWML in cUS images. This model combines a soft attention model focusing on the PWML localisation and the self balancing focal loss (SBFL) introduced by Lin [Liu et al, arxiv, 2019]. The soft attention mask is a 3D probabilistic map derived from spatial prior knowledge of PWML localisation computed from our dataset.\n\n      Performance of this model is evaluated on a dataset of cUS exams including 21 patients acquired with a Acuson Siemens 4-9 MHZ probe. For each exam, a 3D volume of dimension 360x400x380 was reconstructed with an isotropic spatial resolution of 0.15 mm.  A total of 547 lesions were delineated on the images by an expert pediatrician. For this study, we considered 131 lesions with a volume bigger than 1.7 $mm^3$. Volumes of PWM lesions range from 1.75 $mm^3$ to 61.09 $mm^3$ with a median size of 4 $mm^3$.\n\n      The deep model was trained and validated with a 10-fold cross-validation based on approximately 3000 coronal slices extracted from the 3D volumes .  We also performed an ablation study to evaluate the impact of the attention gate and the focal loss. Detection performance was assessed at the lesion level, thus meaning that we performed a cluster analysis on the label maps outputted by the network using a 3D connectivity rule to identify the connected components.\n\n      Compared to the U-Net, the priority U-Net with SBFL increases the recall and the precision in the detection task from 0.4404\n      to 0.5370 and from 0.3217 to 0.5043, respectively. The Dice metric is also increased from 0.3040 to 0.3839 in the segmentation task.\n\n      In this study, we proposed the first use case of automated detection of PWML in cUS exams of preterms neonates as well as a novel deep architecture inspired from the attention gated U-Net combined with the self-balancing focal loss. Our results are shown to outperform the standard U-Net for this challenging detection task.",

        "abstract": "Standard practice for using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in semantic segmentation tasks assumes that the image intensities are directly used for training and inference. In natural images this is performed using RGB pixel intensities, whereas in medical imaging, e.g. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), gray level pixel intensities are typically used. In this work, we explore the idea of encoding the image data as local binary textural maps prior to the feeding them to CNNs, and show that accurate segmentation models can be developed using such maps alone, without learning any representations from the images themselves. This questions common consensus that CNNs recognize objects from images by learning increasingly complex representations of shape, and suggests a more important role to image texture, in line with recent findings on natural images. We illustrate this for the first time on neuroimaging data of the developing neonatal brain in a tissue segmentation task, by analyzing large, publicly available T2-weighted MRI scans (n=558, range of postmenstrual ages at scan: 24.3 - 42.2 weeks) obtained retrospectively from the Developing Human Connectome Project cohort. Rapid changes in visual characteristics that take place during early brain development make it important to establish a clear understanding of the role of visual texture when training CNN models on neuroimaging data of the neonatal brain; this yet remains a largely understudied but important area of research. From a deep learning perspective, the results suggest that CNNs could simply be capable of learning representations from structured spatial information, and may not necessarily require conventional images as input.

        "abstract": "Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) has shown promising results in the detection of prostate cancer (PCa). However, discriminating clinically significant (CS) from benign lesions is time demanding and challenging, even for experienced readers, especially when individual MR sequences yield conflicting findings. Computer aided detection (CADe) or diagnostic (CADx) systems based on standard or deep supervised machine learning have achieved high performance in assisting radiologists for this diagnostic binary detection task.\n      We aim to go one step further in the diagnostic refinement by characterizing the aggressiveness of PCa lesions, assessed by the Gleason score (GS) group grading. This challenging problem has been very recently addressed from the deep learning perspective by a few groups.\n      In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end multiclass deep network to jointly perform the segmentation of the peripheral prostate zone (PZ) as well as the detection and GS Group grading of PZ lesions. Our U-Net inspired  architecture is constituted from a standard encoding part that first extracts the latent information from multichannel T2 weighted (T2w) and  apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) input images. This latent representation is then connected to two separate decoding branches : 1) the first one performs a binary PZ segmentation 2) the second branch uses this zonal prior as an attention gate for the detection and grading of PZ lesions.\n      Performance of this model was evaluated on a dataset of 98 mp-MRI exams including 57 exams acquired on a 1.5 Tesla scanner (Symphony; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) and 41 exams acquired on a 3 Tesla scanner (Discovery; General Electric, Milwaukee, USA). All patients underwent a prostatectomy after the MR exams. The prostatectomy specimens were analyzed a posteriori by an anatomopathologist thus providing the histological ground.  A total of 132 lesions were delineated on the images, including 37, 47, 23, 16 and 9 lesions of GS 6, 3+4, 4+3, 8 and \u2265 9, respectively. All lesions with a GS > 6 were considered as clinically significant.\n      The deep model was trained and validated with a 5-fold cross-validation. Performance of our model was compared to a U-Net baseline model to assess the impact of the self attention module on PCa detection.\n      A free-response receiver operating (FROC) analysis was conducted to evaluate the performance in detecting CS lesions and to discriminate lesions of the different GS groups.\n      Regarding the detection of CS lesions, our model achieves 75.78% sensitivity at 2.5 false positive per patient. Regarding the automatic GS group grading, the Cohen quadratic weighted kappa coefficient is 0.35, which is considered as a fair agreement and an improvement with regards to the baseline model. Our model reaches 78% and 18% sensitivity for GS \u2265 9 and GS 6 at 1 false positive per patient, respectively.\n      Our method achieves good performance without requiring any prior manual region delineation in clinical practice. We show that the addition of the proposed self attention mechanism improves the CAD performance in comparison to the baseline model.\n      ",

This can be limiting when it comes to rapidly extracting relevant clinical parameters. In many applications, availability of reconstructed images with high fidelity may not be a priority as long as biomarker extraction is reliable and feasible. Built upon this concept, we demonstrate that it is possible to perform tissue segmentation directly from highly undersampled k-space and obtain quality results comparable to those in fully-sampled scenarios. We propose 'TB-recon', a 3D task-based reconstruction framework. TB-recon simultaneously reconstructs MRIs from raw data and segments tissues of interest. To do so, we devised a network architecture with a shared encoding path and two task-related decoders where features flow among tasks. We deployed TB-recon on a set of (up to $24\\times$) retrospectively undersampled MRIs from the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset, where we automatically segmented knee cartilage and menisci. An experimental study was conducted showing the superior performance of the proposed method over a combination of a standard MRI reconstruction and segmentation method, as well as alternative deep learning based solutions. In addition, our ablation study highlighted the importance of skip connections among the decoders for the segmentation task. Ultimately, we conducted a reader study, where two musculoskeletal radiologists assessed the proposed model\u2019s reconstruction performance.",

The main goal is to analyse if a model trained in one of two modalities, Fundus Photography (FP) or Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (SLO), is transferable to the other modality accurately. This is motivated by the lack of development and data available in en-face imaging modalities other than FP. FP and SLO images of four and two publicly available datasets, respectively, were used. First, the current approaches were reviewed in order to define a basic pipeline for vessel segmentation. A state-of-art deep learning architecture (U-net) was used, and the effect of varying the patch size and number of patches was studied by training, validating, and testing on each dataset individually. Next, the model was trained in either FP or SLO images, using the available datasets for a given modality combined. Finally, the performance of each network was tested on the other modality. The models trained on each dataset showed a performance comparable to the state-of-the art and to the inter-rater reliability. Overall, the best performance was observed for the largest patch size (256) and the maximum number of overlapped images in each dataset, with a mean sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Dice score of 0.89$\\pm$0.05, 0.95$\\pm$0.02, 0.95$\\pm$0.02, and 0.73$\\pm$0.07, respectively.

        "abstract": "Calcified plaque in the aorta and pelvic arteries is associated with coronary artery calcification and is a strong predictor of heart attack. Current calcified plaque detection models show poor generalizeability to different domains (ie. pre-contrast vs. post-contrast CT scans). Many recent works have shown how cross domain object detection can be improved using an image translation model which translates between domains using a single shared latent space. However, while current image translation models do a good job preserving global/intermediate level structures they often have trouble preserving tiny structures. In medical imaging applications, preserving small structures is important since these structures can carry information which is highly relevant for disease diagnosis. Recent works on image reconstruction show that complex real-world images are better reconstructed using a union of subspaces approach. Since small image patches are used to train the image translation model, it makes sense to enforce that each patch be represented by a linear combination of subspaces which may correspond to the different parts of the body present in that patch. Motivated by this, we propose an image translation network using a shared union of subspaces constraint and show our approach preserves subtle structures (plaques) better than the conventional method. We further applied our method to a cross domain plaque detection task and show significant improvement compared to the state-of-the art method.",

        "abstract": "Automatic segmentation of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains highly sought after due to the potential to streamline and alleviate clinical workflows. WMHs are small relative to whole acquired volume, which leads to class imbalance issues, and instability during the training process of many deep learning based solutions. To address this, we propose a method which is robust to effects of class imbalance, through incorporating multi-scale information in the training process. Our method consists of training an encoder-decoder neural network utilizing a Siamese network as an auxiliary loss function. These Siamese networks take in pairs of image pairs, input images masked with ground truth labels, and input images masked with predictions, and computes multi-resolution feature vector representations and provides gradient feedback in the form of a L2 norm. We leverage transfer learning in our Siamese network, and present positive results without need to further train. It was found these methods are more robust for training segmentation neural networks and provide greater generalizability. Our method was cross-validated on multi-center data, yielding significant overall agreement with manual annotations. ",

        "abstract": "Deep learning techniques are increasingly being developed for several applications in radiology, for example landmark and organ localization with segmentation. However, these applications to date have been limited in nature, in that, they are restricted to just a single task e.g. localization of tumors or to a specific organ using supervised training by an expert. As a result, to develop a radiological decision support system, it would need to be equipped with potentially hundreds of deep learning models with each model trained for a specific task or organ. This would be both space and computationally expensive. In addition, the true potential of deep learning methods in radiology can only be achieved when the model is adaptable and generalizable to multiple different tasks. To that end, we have developed and implemented a multitask modality invariant deep reinforcement learning framework (MIDRL) for landmark localization and segmentation in radiological applications.  MIDRL was evaluated using a diverse data set containing multiparametric MRIs (mpMRI) acquired from different organs and with different imaging parameters. The MIDRL framework was trained to localize six different anatomical structures throughout the body, including, knee, trochanter, heart, kidney, breast nipple, and prostate across T1 weighted, T2 weighted, Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE), Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), and DIXON MRI sequences obtained from twenty-four breast, eight prostate, and twenty five whole body mpMRIs. The trained MIDRL framework produced excellent accuracy in localizing each of the six anatomical landmarks with an average dice similarity$>$0.77, except for breast nipple localization in DCE. In conclusion, we developed  a multitask deep reinforcement learning framework and demonstrated MIDRL\u2019s potential towards the development of a general AI for a radiological decision support system.",

Studies that do not correct for these scanner/site biases at best lose statistical power, and at worst leave spurious correlations in their data. Estimation of the bias effects is non-trivial due to the paucity of data with correspondence across sites, so called \"traveling phantom\" data, which is expensive to collect. Nevertheless, numerous solutions leveraging direct correspondence have been proposed. In contrast to this, Moyer et al. (2019) proposes an unsupervised solution using invariant representations, one which does not require correspondence and thus does not require paired images. By leveraging the data processing inequality, an invariant representation can then be used to create an image reconstruction that is uninformative of its original source, yet still faithful to the underlying structure. In the present abstract we provide an overview of this method.",

Results reveal that the connected regions with high structural differences between groups are those also reported in previous AD literature.

        "abstract": "An emerging technology in cancer care and research is the use of histopathology whole slide images (WSI). Leveraging computation methods to aid in WSI assessment poses unique challenges. WSIs, being extremely high resolution giga-pixel images, cannot be directly processed by convolutional neural networks (CNN) due to huge computational cost. For this reason, state-of-the-art methods for WSI analysis adopt a two-stage approach where the training of a tile encoder is decoupled from the tile aggregation. This results in a trade-off between learning diverse and discriminative features. In contrast, we propose end-to-end part learning (EPL) which is able to learn diverse features while ensuring that learned features are discriminative. Each WSI is modeled as consisting of $k$ groups of tiles with similar features, defined as parts. A loss with respect to the slide label is backpropagated through an integrated CNN model to $k$ input tiles that are used to represent each part. Our experiments show that EPL is capable of clinical grade prediction of prostate and basal cell carcinoma. Further, we show that diverse discriminative features produced by EPL succeeds in multi-label classification of lung cancer architectural subtypes. Beyond classification, our method provides rich information of slides for high quality clinical decision support.",

A feature generator, a Wasserstein distance estimator, a domain discriminator, and a classifier were included in the model to enforce the extraction of domain invariant representations. We applied the model to OCT images as well as public digit images. Results show that the model can significantly improve the classification accuracy of cross-domain images.",

        "abstract": "To successfully train a cell segmentation network in fully-supervised manner for a particular type of organ or cancer, we need the dataset with ground-truth annotations. However, high unavailability of such annotated dataset and tedious labeling process enforce us to discover a way for training with unlabeled dataset. In this paper, we propose a network named CellSegUDA for cell segmentation on the unlabeled dataset (target domain). It is achieved by applying unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) technique with the help of another labeled dataset (source domain) that may come from other organs or sources. We validate our proposed CellSegUDA on two public cell segmentation datasets and obtain significant improvement as compared with the baseline methods. Finally, considering the scenario when we have a small number of annotations available from the target domain, we extend our work to CellSegSSDA, a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) based approach. Our SSDA model also gives excellent results which are quite close to the fully-supervised upper bound in target domain.",
